# Fail Log Summary
This is a summary of my fail log week by week
## Week 1
Week one was relatively simple and straightforward. I only found issue when I went too quickly or had to jump around a lot. 
## Week 2
Week two was substantially more difficult that week one, but with a little bit of patience I was able to get everything to work. My largest issue was one with myself, where I repeatedly reset my DHBox without remembering to save my history, resulting in myself forgetting to record my fails. Fortunately, by doing the exercises multiple times, I was familliar enough with them to help out my classmates.
