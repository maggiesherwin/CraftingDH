# Week 2
(this will not be great because I forgot once again to write down what I was doing as I was doing it)
## Activities
#### Markdown Syntax
I found this part to be relatively easy, as I enjoy digital syntax a lot. But, being experienced in HTML made using Markdown an interesting experience where I found myself frustrated by the limited capablites, instead of feeling freer from not having to deal with as much code. 

The inline/reference difference confused me, but I read somewhere that you should always use reference, so I did that. Plus, reference links make the code easier to read, and are also similar to the code used by Tumblr (where I learned HTML), so I preferred it. 

#### DHBox
My experience with command line is that I find the command I am looking for somewhere else, and proceed to dump it in without even knowing what I am doing. I found this excersise to be helpful in understanding exactly what commands do (even though I still don't completely understand). I also found the way that we can use programs within command line to do more really interesting! I had no idea this could be done. 

#### DHBox and GitHub
I found exercise 3 to be a little pointless, if only because we had already set up our repositories in week 1. but exercise 4 was where I struggled. 

## WINS
- I got everything to work (eventually)

## Fails
- I forgot to save a list of my commands
- I refreshed DHBox every time my screen was full, losing my history every time

## What I learned

#### Patience
I learned (as I do all the time) that I need to work on my patience, and stop thinking that I know how to do things correctly the first time. This came into play when I was attempting to fork, clone, branch, add files to, and push a repository. I had to try this three times before actually getting it, and all I was doing was forgetting to commit changes. It was frustrating, but I did get it, and now I have a list of the commands I need to remember to do when doing this. 

#### Style vs. Substance
As someone to whom visuals matter a lot, it is difficult for me to accept that much of the work I do in this class will have no reason to look nice/stylized. With the dillinger.io exercise I found myself trying desperately to make the images smaller because I do not enjoy looking at giant images that fill the entire page. But then Dr. Graham explained that Markdown is mainly for getting your information organized so that it is ready to be stylized when it is published. So, as someone who learned HTML at a young age and specifically learned how to use HTML to make pages look how I want, it was surprisingly hard to deal with markdown. Weirdly it feels like a simplification of HTML and deceptively easy. I keep waiting for it to become harder to use, but it is relatively simple.
