## What I learned

#### Patience
I learned (as I do all the time) that I need to work on my patience, and stop thinking that I know how to do things correctly the first time. This came into play when I was attempting to fork, clone, branch, add files to, and push a repository. I had to try this three times before actually getting it, and all I was doing was forgetting to commit changes. It was frustrating, but I did get it, and now I have a list of the commands I need to remember to do when doing this. 

#### Style vs. Substance
As someone to whom visuals matter a lot, it is difficult for me to accept that much of the work I do in this class will have no reason to look nice/stylized. With the dillinger.io exercise I found myself trying desperately to make the images smaller because I do not enjoy looking at giant images that fill the entire page. But then Dr. Graham explained that Markdown is mainly for getting your information organized so that it is ready to be stylized when it is published. So, as someone who learned HTML at a young age and specifically learned how to use HTML to make pages look how I want, it was surprisingly hard to deal with markdown. Weirdly it feels like a simplification of HTML and deceptively easy. I keep waiting for it to become harder to use, but it is relatively simple. 


## Prompt
*Is this where this belongs??? I am not entirely sure???*

1. How are these scholars portraying themselves?
2. How do they approach the idea of 'openness'?
3. How is your own work 'generous'?

#### Trevor Owens
Owens' "about me" section is mainly about his credentials, showing that he does know what he is talking about. From this, Owens seems to be focused incredibly on the importance of facts and evidence, which is also reflected in his article. His idea of 'openness' more as transparency, where people can be called out and have to be able to prove where their ideas are from.

#### W. Caleb McDaniel
I find it interesting that McDaniel's about me is also his CV. Like Owens, this "about me" is mainly showing his achievements and credentials, and not about his approach to history. There is nothing personal or revealing that helps me understand his persepctive more. His idea of openness is of making notebooks and sources available, which I find to be problematic when it comes to the value of theories and research, and copyright law.
