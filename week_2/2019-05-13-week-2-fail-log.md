## What I learned

#### Patience
I learned (as I do all the time) that I need to work on my patience, and stop thinking that I know how to do things correctly the first time. This came into play when I was attempting to fork, clone, branch, add files to, and push a repository. I had to try this three times before actually getting it, and all I was doing was forgetting to commit changes. It was frustrating, but I did get it, and now I have a list of the commands I need to remember to do when doing this. 

#### Style vs. Substance
As someone to whom visuals matter a lot, it is difficult for me to accept that much of the work I do in this class will have no reason to look nice/stylized. With the dillinger.io exercise I found myself trying desperately to make the images smaller because I do not enjoy looking at giant images that fill the entire page. But then Dr. Graham explained that Markdown is mainly for getting your information organized so that it is ready to be stylized when it is published. So, as someone who learned HTML at a young age and specifically learned how to use HTML to make pages look how I want, it was surprisingly hard to deal with markdown. Weirdly it feels like a simplification of HTML and deceptively easy. I keep waiting for it to become harder to use, but it is relatively simple.
