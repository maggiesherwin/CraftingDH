## Learning and Setting up DHBOX May 18 2019

This is me learning how to use DHBox, Nano, and how to install and set up addons for command Xline. It was also me learning that as much as I hate having my commandline be full, I should not refresh the page at any time I like, because my recent commands were all deleted every time.
