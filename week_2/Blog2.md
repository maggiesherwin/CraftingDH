# Week 2

## Prompt
*Is this where this belongs??? I am not entirely sure???*

1. How are these scholars portraying themselves?
2. How do they approach the idea of 'openness'?
3. How is your own work 'generous'?

#### Trevor Owens
Owens' "about me" section is mainly about his credentials, showing that he does know what he is talking about. From this, Owens seems to be focused incredibly on the importance of facts and evidence, which is also reflected in his article. His idea of 'openness' more as transparency, where people can be called out and have to be able to prove where their ideas are from.

#### W. Caleb McDaniel
I find it interesting that McDaniel's about me is also his CV. Like Owens, this "about me" is mainly showing his achievements and credentials, and not about his approach to history. There is nothing personal or revealing that helps me understand his persepctive more. His idea of openness is of making notebooks and sources available, which I find to be problematic when it comes to the value of theories and research, and copyright law. 

#### Ian Milligan
I am very glad to see that while Milligan does list his credentials, he does also include an "about me" that gives more context to his perspective. I believe that to Milligan, openess is about making sources more available, which in turn will make them less confusing (a consequence of multiple researchers each making their own data record with their own criteria and/or relevant information).

What did I learn?
How did I conduct myself?
Why did I do the things I did? 

Then, make an entry on your blog that contrasts this picture of 'open access research' with what you may have learned about doing history in your other courses. Where are the dangers and where are the opportunities? What does 'open access' mean for you as a student?
