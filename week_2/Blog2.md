# Week 2

## Prompt
1. How are these scholars portraying themselves?
2. How do they approach the idea of 'openness'?
3. How is your own work 'generous'?

#### Trevor Owens
Owens' "about me" section is mainly about his credentials, showing that he does know what he is talking about. From this, Owens seems to be focused incredibly on the importance of facts and evidence, which is also reflected in his article. His idea of 'openness' more as transparency, where people can be called out and have to be able to prove where their ideas are from.

#### W. Caleb McDaniel
I find it interesting that McDaniel's about me is also his CV. Like Owens, this "about me" is mainly showing his achievements and credentials, and not about his approach to history. There is nothing personal or revealing that helps me understand his persepctive more. His idea of openness is of making notebooks and sources available, which I find to be problematic when it comes to the value of theories and research, and copyright law. 

#### Ian Milligan
I am very glad to see that while Milligan does list his credentials, he does also include an "about me" that gives more context to his perspective. I believe that to Milligan, openess is about making sources more available, which in turn will make them less confusing (a consequence of multiple researchers each making their own data record with their own criteria and/or relevant information).

#### Michelle Moravec
Compared to the other "about me" sections, Moravec's is a breath of fresh air. Instead of just listing credentials, Moravec shares her past and goals when it comes to research. This tells me that she is much more open and willing to share her thoughts and ideas freely. Because she shares more personal information on her site, it comes across as a more personal site in general, and feels more human than one written by a person that does not tell their readers about themselves. Her idea of 'openness' is that of open notebooks - much like McDaniel - where the writing process can be shared with others. 

#### Kathleen Fitzpatrick
We are back to the resume biographies! Once again, the "about me" page is mostly a listing of credentials. It is also interesting to note that her "about me" is written in the third person, making it seem more objective than it likely is. 



## A few notes:
- AUTOCORRECT SHOULD WORK IN GITHUB (I understand why it does not, but it is frustrating to see how many mistakes I make without a machine correcting me)
- Many historians make bad websites. 
- It is interesting that historians arguing for open notes and data are more often than not trying to portray themselves as "experts" in their biographies, using their credentials to show that their opinion matters. 
- Historians with websites need to make better "about me" pages. When looking at the below quotes, the second one tells me much more about the person wrriting, while the first is more of a resume than anything else. I do not understand this completely, because the vast majority of readers are not looking to hire the author of what they are reading.

- Many of these ideas would work in a perfect society, but seeing as we live in one where information and knowledge have value, it is hard to see how the ideas discussed in the readings will work practically. For example, if all knowledge is available, there can be no real experts. The purpose of university is to gain more knowledge than available through a basic google search. If all of that information is available online and everyone can learn everything, what is the point in studying anything. As someone with a giant netflix queue that watches maybe one episode of a show every week, I can see this becoming a problem where I have all of these realings and interesting things to learn, but quickly become overwhelmed. It is easier to read the only available source for something (even if it isn't a great source) than it is to read EVERY source about it. Maybe if the robots could read it for me and spit it out in a 4 page document.

Then, make an entry on your blog that contrasts this picture of 'open access research' with what you may have learned about doing history in your other courses. Where are the dangers and where are the opportunities? What does 'open access' mean for you as a student?
