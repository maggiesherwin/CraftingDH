# Week 2

## Prompt
I think that often we can take tools like search engines, or even the monolith of Google, for graned. By this, I mean that we do not see the teams of people working to optimize the code, and often we do not even see the code at all. The fact that students are searching without knowing why the results are the way that they are is a little concerning actually. When we go to the library we are able to meet with experts that have worked first hand with the matierals that we are looking for. On the other hand, many search engines are made by people that will never engage with the text that they are telling you is best. Furthermore, with my new experience with OCRs, I have to say that full text search of PDFs that have not been manually transcribed (or at least transcribed with a VERY good program) leaves much to be desired. 

On the other hand, I also believe that search engines help us in ways that we do not even notice. But it is only when we are able to really understand the search parameters, key words, and search modifiers that we can unlock the real powers of a search engine. Many students will enter their topic in Google or Summons, choose the first few articles, and that is it. They do not take the time to refine and narrow down their search, likely because they trust the algorithm to show them the most relevant links without having to do that. 

In conclusion, students and researchers take the tools at their disposal for granted, failing to use the true potential of them that exists today. They do not refine their searches, nor do they take into account what makes the most relevant search results "relevant". Perhaps in the future we will be able to accurately scan any document for any topic and recieve relevant results. But academics need to know how to use the tools as they exist today if they want to have any say in how they evolve. 

## Activities
### The Dream Case
When looking through these sites, I was very intimidated by the Epigraphic database, simply because of the use of latin which I do not know. I did try looking up figlina, and was interested to see the apparent clusters of potters (or at least inscriptions mentioning potters) in the Roman empire.

The CWGC was a bit more interesting to me, in that it is a bit more personal and is about something I understand much better than latin. I searched my great-grandmother's surname Atkinson, as that is the same last name as my great-great uncle (my only family member that served in a war). I was able to find him too! This was really cool for me, because it helped me learn more about my family, and I could also see the records of his grave as well as the men buried near him. I also had no idea he was in Sicily, so that is cool too. 
### Wget
I found this to be relatively easy, especially after spending probably too much time trying to figure out how to copy files from one directory to another through the command line instead of using the file manager. It is incredibly useful though, and I can see it helping me in the future (once I know what to do with everything I just downloaded that is)
### TEI
Being experienced with HTML I found this exercise very easy. I also enjoyed transcribing the text, and with what I learned from the Tesseract exercise, I also see how manual transcription is a skill and tool that many should have.
### APIs
I have mixed feelings about APIs. On one hand, the binders made everything feel too easy. I simply click `run` and they worked. Some worked better than others though, such as the one for the Portable Antiques Scheme database, which I was able to use to find many different things! It did make me interested in APIs, in that they are a POWERFUL tool that we can use in order to quickly search things and even make sense of those results. I just wish that I had more experience with them, or knew all of the syntax I need in order to really use them.
### Mining Twitter
This was also fun! I searched twitter for "BOSJ" which is an acronym for a wrestling tournament happening right now. It helped me see which wrestlers were being talked about the most, which I found very interesting. One thing I do wish was that I was able to change the results in order to block certain words in the wordcloud. If I could have, I would have blocked the term "BOSJ" in order to see how the other results compare to each other without a term that has hunndreds of results. 
### Tesseract
In this exercise I finally updated everything in my DHBox. It took a few hours, but I hope it was worth it?? 

The results from Tesseract were so bad. SO BAD. I honestly believe that loading the .jpeg into photoshop, changing the contrast, and then turning it into a .pdf in order for acrobat to convert it to text would have yielded better results. I was able to run everything in RStudio, and I hope we will work with it more, as it seems to be a good way to to things in large amounts.
