# Week 4

## Prompt
Data cleaning is like the mouldy sandwich under the bed of digital history. It is not great, not fun to deal with, and is starting to stick up the whole room. I think that we like to pretend it isn't there mainly because if most people knew that working with data means a lot of manual clean up that takes a lot of manhours, it becomes much less appealing. But, I do think that data cleaning is kind of like the gatekeeper between using data and creating data. It is what makes people say either "this is good enough" or "this needs to be fixed". And no matter how many tools or programs are created, the need for a human to be able to go through the data carefully will never disappear. 

When it comes to cleaning data though, it is also important to note that relevant things might be found in what you believe can be removed. It is why it is important to keep multiple versions of everything, so that you always have access to the original and every iteration that exists. When thinking of what could be lost, my mind goes to things like margin notes, manual corrections, and perhaps purposeful spelling errors. Many of these things would be looked at by a program and be seen as "incorrect", whereas a human is able to look at the whole and see where things belong. Specifically I think of the notes monks made in the margins of manuscripts. These notes are incredibly important when studying almost anything about books, monks, and scholarship. They give us insight into the text, and often make it easier or at least more entertaining to read.

But, it is also important to note that everything cannot be relevant all the time, and that we need to accept that some things might have to be left out of a data set. I believe that there does need to be at least one complete unedited version of a transcription, as it allows us to return to it time after time in order to pick and choose the relevant information for a project. 

So, I am currently finishing my readings and annotations, and when reading the article about newspapers, my mind automatically went to the challenges that would surround archiving zines (self published magazines). Archive.org has a pretty good existing archive [here](https://archive.org/details/zines) but as someone that has made multiple zines, it is difficult to separate the text from the image. It is also more difficult because zines have limited copies and are often created manually, meaning that if the original is lost then it is gone forever. It just occurred to me as a really fun possible project that I wish I had the resources to undertake something like it, nevermind that I would not even have a use for it. It's just my heart wanting these pieces of culture to be saved in an accessible way. It just struck me that unless I go to a zine library or the author kept a copy, I will likely never again see the zines my friend made when we were 16. 
 
### Regex & Texas
Because I could see a specific name that was incorrectly scanned, I decided to look online for an original scanned copy to compare. Found out it was an Ã©, and I used the code `c6|c\^` to replace what I wanted. I learned that `\` followed by a special character makes it recognize that character as text and not code. Unfortunately, I don't think that indepth Regex is something I will use in the future, unless it is only to find specific terms. When it comes to replacing, I am simply too worried about accidentally changing something that I won't catch afterwards. 
### Open Refine
THIS. WAS. REALLY. COOL. I really enjoy using this program, mainly because it made editing a large excel file easy to deal with. Fortunately because much of the irrelevant data had already been removed, it made it relatively easy to work with. I also made the effort to turn entries such as "secretary of state of texas" into the actual names of the secretery of state at the time in order to make sure that all letters to the man in that position were linked to the letters he recieved while not in office. 
### Capstone exercise
I got a little more into the capstone exercise this week. I finally actually read the war diaries, and decided to track the movement of Nursing Sisters over time. My only issue I have come across is when the personnel records do not match the movements marked down. What I have decided to do is just continue with what the actual logs tell me, ignore the personnel numbers, and make a note that they do not match. By doing this, I am able to record what the logs say while not brushing the discrepancy under the rug. It is important to not be afraid of noting when things do not make sense, because often they do not.
