## Week 1

The first thing I would like to say is that I need to be better at remembering to list everyhting I do in real time, and to not rely on my memory when I come to this part of the week. This might mean I get a secondary monitor, or even use a manual notebook (Which I forgot to use when working on this week). I found setting up my machine to be relatively easy, as I have experience with virtual machines and VPNs. When it came to GitHub though I found myself to be a little overwhelmed. This is mainly because all of my other expierences of GitHub were usually of me trying to find a program, getting led to GitHub, and then being overwhelmed by... all of it. But, hopefully as I explore more I will be able to get used to it and maybe even enjoy using it. 

Doing all of the readings made me excited to move forward, although next week I need to be more concious about setting time aside to work on this class, instead of relying on myself finding the time and motivation to work on it. As much as I enjoy what this class is working on, I found myself delaying work because it relies on a machine that I do not often have beside me. 

In general I think that most of my issues with the course will be outside of the class scope, and mainly rely on me being a more active student. This is another part of the class I enjoy, that it will make me have to become a student that has to plan things out and think about my methodologies.
