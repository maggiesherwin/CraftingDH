# In the Beginning...
I found this first week relatively straightforward and easy to complete. I began by reading through the syllabus, getting confused by the syllabus, and then marking down the parts I did not understand so I can try to figure them out later by highlighting them. You might also notice a lot of updates to my pages, as I like to frequently save in order to avoid losing anything. The benefits of having parents that do mainly digital work and cannot afford to lose anything.

## First Annotation
My [first annotation](https://hyp.is/GWiT7HDoEem9pe8EFtgT-A/site.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/first-things-first.html) was me commenting on the question of how Google has shaped/is shaping our historical conciousness and the ways that we think about history and event the truth. When I first learned about SEO I was admittedly confused as I had thought that the most relevant search results would always show up first. This changed how I thought about Google and even how I now word my Google queries.  

## Second Annotation
With my [second annotation](https://hyp.is/aoWWQnDqEemekIOYlJeEsA/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/) I learned how to link GIFs in Hypothesis. YES. It is interesting to see how different sites choose what types of links they will allow to show images. For instance, when I tried using a shortened link to attach this GIF, it would not load. It only loaded once I used the full link. 

## Third Annotation
My [third annotation](https://hyp.is/FhDMDnDuEemuymfhkFAccA/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/) is my misunderstanding of what annotation means. I was unclear about whether or not we should submit our own annotations, and if so what annotations we should be submitting. I eventually asked Dr. Graham, which worked to remind me to **NOT BE AFRAID OF ASKING QUESTIONS.**


## Comments/Concerns

Overall, this week went well. It seemed daunting at first, but I soon realized that everyone makes mistakes, especially when they are learning new skills, using new software, etc. **Making mistakes is part of the process and necessary to learn.**

I learned quite a few things this week, one being how to move a file around on GitHub. I also learned that you have to add .md to the end of filenames in order for them to not look like HTML text but an actual readable page.
