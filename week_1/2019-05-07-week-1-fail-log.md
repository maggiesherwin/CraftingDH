# In the Beginning...
I found this first week relatively straightforward and easy to complete. I began by reading through the syllabus, getting confused by the syllabus, and then marking down the parts I did not understand so I can try to figure them out later by highlighting them.

## First Annotation
My [first annotation](https://hyp.is/GWiT7HDoEem9pe8EFtgT-A/site.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/first-things-first.html) was me commenting on the question of how Google has shaped/is shaping our historical conciousness and the ways that we think about history and event the truth. When I first learned about SEO I was admittedly confused as I had thought that the most relevant search results would always show up first.

I learned quite a few things this week, one being how to move a file around on GitHub.
