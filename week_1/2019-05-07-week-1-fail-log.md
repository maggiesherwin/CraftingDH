# In the Beginning...
I found this first week relatively straightforward and easy to complete.    

## First Annotation
My [first annotation](https://hyp.is/GWiT7HDoEem9pe8EFtgT-A/site.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/first-things-first.html) was me commenting on the question of how Google has shaped/is shaping our historical conciousness and the ways that we think about history and event the truth. When I first learned about SEO I was admittedly confused as I had thought that the most relevant search results would always show up first. This changed how I thought about Google and even how I now word my Google queries.  

## Second Annotation
With my [second annotation](https://hyp.is/aoWWQnDqEemekIOYlJeEsA/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/) I learned how to link GIFs in Hypothesis. YES. It is interesting to see how different sites choose what types of links they will allow to show images. For instance, when I tried using a shortened link to attach this GIF, it would not load. It only loaded once I used the full link. 

## Third Annotation
My [third annotation](https://hyp.is/P-j0AFh8EemYXn9Z1Pmgww/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/) was a case of me learning about where I download/install programs and plugins. When I created my Hypothesis account, I downloaded the plugin for Google Chrome. Later, I went onto the course workbook and tried to annotate, but I couldn't find the Hypothesis button. After searching for a while I realized that I was using the Safari browser. I switched back to Chrome and was able to annotate.

This experience taught me about paying attention to where I install software and that these plugins are browser specific. 

## Comments/Concerns

Overall, this week went well. It seemed daunting at first, but I soon realized that everyone makes mistakes, especially when they are learning new skills, using new software, etc. **Making mistakes is part of the process and necessary to learn.**

I am a bit concerned about diving into GitHub next week, but I see there are instruction videos which I imagine will help a lot!
