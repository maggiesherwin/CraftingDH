# Week 5

## Prompt
Select one of the articles behind the links above (and/or in the exercises) to annotate. Ask yourself: who benefits from this? Who is hurt from this? Make an entry in your blog on this theme.

For the exercises, I found myself thinking about who benefits and who is hurt in the context of "what tool can give me the most information in a way that I can understand". By this I mean that no relevant information is left behind, or is presented in a way that would make me dismiss it as irrelevant. 

## Exercises
### Gephi
I found this tool to be really interesting! It was cool being able to actually visualize over 900 lines of data in a single image. I also enjoyed playing around with different filters and effects to create different images.
### Topic Modeling Tool
Honestly, this tool was hard for me to understand, mostly because of the VERY basic user interface which does not give enough context to what you are looking at. Because of this, I dismissed what I was looking at, possibly losing out on the chance to gain new insight.
### Topic Modeling in R
I had some issues with this, but overall I found the results to be much better than the Topic Modeling Tool. I was actually given a lot of information in a way that I can understand, as opposed to being so complicated I became blind to the information being presented to me. 
### Overview
I think that this tool will be really useful when looking for how often words are used. It is also useful for recognizing names and places, but I still wouldn't completely trust it to find every instance. It is also a little dangerous in that it depends on researchers' ability to think of synonyms and different ways to search the same thing.
