# Week 5

## Prompt
The readings this week really made me think about how information is read and portrayed, and how important it is to consider. Once again, I will bring up synonyms, and the fact that it is difficult for us to remember every search term we should search. WHY IS THIS NOT A COMMON SEARCH FEATURE?? This is especially important when considering diaries and letters, which might include slang or regional terms. When we forget these things, we are automatically devaluing the works that use them because we have filtered them out through our own ignorance. 

Visualizations can also hurt the work that a historian does in order to make the visualization itself, in that they distill so much research into a single image. While this might be useful when used with a larger text, there are many readers that will look at a visualization and assume that it is all they need in order to understand something. My mind goes to graphs whose correlation seems to suggest a trend or connection, but in reality there is no way to connect them. And yet, some will look at this graph and believe it to be revealing new information, never realizing that what they have learned is completely arbitrary.

Visualizations are beneficial in the ways that they can provide a very surface expression of a lot of information, an expression that can be useful at the beginning, or used within the context of a larger work. They can reveal things that staring at text cannot show, and can help a more in-depth work, but can never supplement it. 

For the exercises, I found myself thinking about who benefits and who is hurt in the context of "what tool can give me the most information in a way that I can understand". By this I mean that no relevant information is left behind, or is presented in a way that would make me dismiss it as irrelevant. 

## Exercises
### Gephi
I found this tool to be really interesting! It was cool being able to actually visualize over 900 lines of data in a single image. I also enjoyed playing around with different filters and effects to create different images.
### Topic Modeling Tool
Honestly, this tool was hard for me to understand, mostly because of the VERY basic user interface which does not give enough context to what you are looking at. Because of this, I dismissed what I was looking at, possibly losing out on the chance to gain new insight.
### Topic Modeling in R
I had some issues with this, but overall I found the results to be much better than the Topic Modeling Tool. I was actually given a lot of information in a way that I can understand, as opposed to being so complicated I became blind to the information being presented to me. 
### Overview
I think that this tool will be really useful when looking for how often words are used. It is also useful for recognizing names and places, but I still wouldn't completely trust it to find every instance. It is also a little dangerous in that it depends on researchers' ability to think of synonyms and different ways to search the same thing.
